### What is NCOR?

NCOR (The Ontology Research & Development Network) is a global non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the field of ontology through fostering National Centers for Ontological Research in different countries around the world.

### What is the relationship between NCOR and CCO?

The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) is one of the ontology projects supported by NCOR. CCO provides a mid-level ontology suite that bridges upper ontologies like BFO with domain-specific implementations.

### How can I establish an NCOR center in my country?

Contact the NCOR leadership to discuss establishing a national center for ontological research in your country. Each center maintains its cultural uniqueness while adhering to shared standards for disambiguation and interoperability.

### Where can I get training in ontology development?

NCOR offers various training opportunities through its national centers, including workshops, courses, and mentorship programs. Check the [working groups](/docs/support/working-groups) page for more information.

### How can ontologies help with AI systems?

Ontologies provide semantic foundations for AI systems, ensuring that data is properly structured, unambiguous, and contextually relevant. This is especially important for cross-cultural AI applications where meaning may vary across contexts.
