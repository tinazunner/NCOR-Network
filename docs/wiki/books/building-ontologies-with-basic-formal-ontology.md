## About the book

An introduction to the field of applied ontology with examples derived particularly from biomedicine, covering theoretical components, design practices, and practical applications.
In the era of “big data,” science is increasingly information driven, and the potential for computers to store, manage, and integrate massive amounts of data has given rise to such new disciplinary fields as biomedical informatics. Applied ontology offers a strategy for the organization of scientific information in computer-tractable form, drawing on concepts not only from computer and information science but also from linguistics, logic, and philosophy. This book provides an introduction to the field of applied ontology that is of particular relevance to biomedicine, covering theoretical components of ontologies, best practices for ontology design, and examples of biomedical ontologies in use.

After defining an ontology as a representation of the types of entities in a given domain, the book distinguishes between different kinds of ontologies and taxonomies, and shows how applied ontology draws on more traditional ideas from metaphysics. It presents the core features of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), now used by over one hundred ontology projects around the world, and offers examples of domain ontologies that utilize BFO. The book also describes Web Ontology Language (OWL), a common framework for Semantic Web technologies. Throughout, the book provides concrete recommendations for the design and construction of domain ontologies.

### 4 Principles of Best Practice II: Terms, Definitions, and Classification

- Principles for Terminology 
- Gather and Select Terminology
  - 1. Include in the terminology terms used by scientists 
  - 2. Strive to ensure maximal consensus with the scientists' usage 
  - 3. Identify areas of disciplinary overlap where terminological usage is not consistent 
  - 4. In terminology construction and ontology design, make use of as many existing resources as possible
- Formatting Terminology
  - 5. Use singular nouns
  - 6. Use lowercase for common nouns
  - 7. Avoid acronyms
  - 8. Associate each term in the ontology with a unique alphanumeric identifier
  - 9. Ensure univocity of terms
  - 10. Ensure univocity of relational expressions
  - 11. Avoid mass terms
  - 12. Distinguish the general from the particular
- Principles for Definitions
  - 13. Provide all nonroot terms with definitions
  - 14. Use Aristotelian definitions
  - 15. Use essential features in defining terms
  - 16. Start with the most general terms in your domain
  - 17. Avoid circularity in defining terms
  - 18. To ensure the intelligibility of definitions, use simpler terms than the term you are defining
  - 19. Do not create terms for universals through logical combination
  - 20. Definitions should be unpackable (Term-definition intersubstitutability)
- Principles for Taxonomies
  - 21. Structure every ontology around a backbone _is_a_ hierarchy
  - 22. Ensure _is_a_ completeness
  - 23. Ensure asserted single inheritance
  - 24. Both developers and users of an ontology should respect the open-world assumption
  - 25. Adhere to the rule of objectivity: describe what exists in reality, not what is known about what exists
- Conclusion 
- Further Readings on Definitions and Categorization 
- Examples of Critical Reviews
