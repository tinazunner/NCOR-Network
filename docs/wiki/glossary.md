This is the glossary for the National Center for Ontological Research.

## A

**Adequatism**: The principle that an ontology should be designed to include all entities that are relevant to the domain being modeled, without artificially restricting the scope.

**Aristotelian definition**: A definition that follows the form of genus-differentia, specifying what kind the defined entity is and how it differs from other members of that kind.

## B

**Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)**: A top-level ontology designed to support information integration, retrieval and analysis across diverse domains. BFO is characterized by its realist approach and provides a framework of formally defined terms representing basic entities such as objects, processes, functions, and roles.

**BFO 2.0**: The second major version of the Basic Formal Ontology, providing a more comprehensive framework for ontological modeling.

## C

**Class**: A category of entities that share common characteristics.

**Conceptualism**: The philosophical position that universals exist only within the mind or as mental constructs.

**Continuant**: An entity that persists, endures, or continues to exist through time while maintaining its identity. Contrasted with occurrent.

## D

**Defined Class**: A class that is defined by necessary and sufficient conditions for membership.

**Domain Ontology**: An ontology whose scope is a specific subject area or discipline, such as medicine, finance, or engineering.

## E

**Entity**: The most general type in BFO, encompassing everything that exists.

## F

**Fallibilism**: The principle that an ontology may contain errors and should be subject to revision as knowledge advances.

**Formal Ontology**: An ontology concerned with general categories applicable across domains.

## I

**Interoperability**: The capacity of distinct systems, schemas, ontologies, and so on to be integrated and maintain integration without special effort. 

**Is_a**: The foundational relation in ontologies, indicating that one type is a subtype of another.

## M

**Material Ontology**: An ontology concerned with specific kinds of entities in specific domains.

## O

**Occurrent**: An entity that happens, unfolds, or develops through time. Examples include processes and events.

**Ontology**: A formal representation of the entities, types, properties, and relations that exist in a domain, designed to enable knowledge sharing and reuse.

## P

**Particular**: An individual entity, as contrasted with a universal.

**Perspectivalism**: The principle that an ontology represents one among multiple legitimate perspectives on reality.

## R

**Realism**: The philosophical position that reality exists independently of human thought and perception.

## T

**Taxonomy**: A hierarchical classification of entities.

**Top-Level Ontology**: An ontology that defines very general categories applicable across all domains.

## U

**Universal**: A repeatable feature of reality, instantiated by particulars. In BFO, universals are contrasted with classes.

**Universal-Universal Relation**: A relation between types or universals, such as is_a or part_of.

**Universal-Particular Relation**: A relation between a universal and an instance, such as instantiation.

**Use-Mention Distinction**: The distinction between using a term to refer to something and mentioning the term itself.
