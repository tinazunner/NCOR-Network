The goal of the [National Center for Ontological Research](https://ubwp.buffalo.edu/ncor/) is to advance ontological investigation within the United States. NCOR serves as a vehicle to coordinate, to enhance, to publicize, and to seek funding for ontological research activities. It lays a special focus on ontology training and on the establishment of tools and measures for quality assurance of ontologies. NCOR provides ontology services to multiple organizations, including the US Department of Defense.

[Article on BFO in the *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung*, September 28, 2022, p. N3](https://buffalo.app.box.com/v/KI-und-Philosophie). Translation of opening paragraph:

:Industry standards are not usually associated with philosophy or the humanities. That is why the new ISO/IEC 21838 standard conceals a minor scientific-historical sensation. Because for the first time, a philosophical theory has now been declared an industry standard, namely: the "Basic Formal Ontology", BFO for short. When you try to pronounce this acronym, it sounds a lot like "Buffalo," and that's no coincidence. Because Barry Smith, the main brain behind this norm, is the Julian Park Professor of Philosophy at the University of Buffalo in northern New York State, not far from Niagara Falls ...

  1. Defining 'Ontology'

An ontology is a representation of some part of reality, (e.g. medicine, social reality, physics, etc.).  Smith states that: “Ontology is the science of what is, of the kinds and structures of objects, properties, events, processes and relations in every area of reality…Ontology seeks to provide a definitive and exhaustive classification of entities in all spheres of being.”  To be an accurate representation of reality an ontology includes the types of entities and events in a given domain (along with their definitions) arranged in a hierarchical structure, along with relations (such as part-of, depends-on, caused-by, etc. where necessary).  Ontologies enable the formulation of robust and shareable descriptions of a given domain by providing a common controlled vocabulary for doctrine writers, IT Developers, and war-fighters alike, thereby allowing these disparate communities to communicate with each other.  An ontology should be a shared resource between communities, and its continued collaborative development should support the integration of information and facilitate knowledge discovery.  These two goals are realized by ensuring wide dissemination of the ontology, so that it will be used by many stakeholders, and its terms will be correspondingly familiar and readily used for search.

*The Wernicke Ontology Principle*

Wernicke is an ontology-dependent AI system used to automate recurring business processes. Wernicke is based on formal logic developed by Jobst Landgrebe and co-workers at Cognotekt. Its ontologies do not have an Aristotelian taxonomic structure, but are fully axiomatised and logically describe the syntactic structure of recurring language patterns in the Prolog-subset of first order logic. The use of terms in two or more axiomatic definitions of ontological entities creates an implicit network structure within the ontology.

Examples (in German)

1. Implication relations for verbs and verb phrases. (There are hundreds of examples of such formulae in each Wernicke ontology.)

  ((zahlung(Y) AND nachkommen(Z) AND verb(Z,X,Y)) IMPL zahlen(Z))
  ((geld(Y) AND schicken(Z) AND (verb(Z,X) OR verb(Z,X,Y1))) IMPL zahlen(Z))
  ((kosten(Y) AND tragen(Z) AND verb(Z,X,Y)) IMPL zahlen(Z))
  ((überweisungsträger(Y) AND einwerfen(Z) AND verb(Z,X,Y)) IMPL zahlen(Z))
  ((bringen(Z) AND ausgleich(A) AND zum(B) AND mod(B,A,Z) AND verb(Z,X,Y)) IMPL zahlen(Z))
  ((möglich(A) AND mod(A,Z) AND sein(Z) AND (verb(Z,X) OR verb(Z,X,Y))) IMPL möglichsein(Z))  
  ((bitten(Z) AND mod(B,A,Z) AND möglichkeit(A) AND verb(Z,X,Y)) IMPL möglichsein(Z))


2. Temporal structures

  ((übermorgen(W) AND (Y2)) IMPL zeitabstand(W,in,Y,tagen))
  ((morgen(W) AND (Y# 1)) IMPL zeitabstand(W,in,Y,tagen))
  ((heute(W) AND (Y0)) IMPL zeitabstand(W,in,Y,tagen))
  ((gestern(W) AND (Y# 1)) IMPL zeitabstand(W,vor,Y,tagen))
  ((vorgestern(W) AND (Y2)) IMPL zeitabstand(W,vor,Y,tagen))

3. Domain pattern formulae (ontologic entities)

  past payment a: ((zahlung(X) OR geld(X)) AND rausgehen(Z) AND (I# vergangen) AND verb(Z,X) AND vergangentemp(Z))
  past payment b: ((zahlung(Y) AND tätigen(Z) AND verb(Z,X,Y) AND (Ivergangen) AND vergangentemp(Z))
  past payment c: ((sein(Z) AND (betrag(X) OR forderung(X)) AND zahlen(A) AND mod(A,Z) AND (I# vergangen)
  AND verb(Z,X) AND NOT temp_mod(Z, praet, konj2)
