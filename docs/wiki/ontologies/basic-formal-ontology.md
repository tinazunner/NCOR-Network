## What is BFO?

BFO is a top-level ontology that provides a common framework for describing the fundamental concepts of reality. It is used by over 700 ontology-based research projects across biomedicine, defense and intelligence, industrial manufacturing, and many other domains. 

### ISO Standardization

BFO 2020 is the latest version of BFO as standardized in ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021. This standard is part of a two-part series:

   - Specifies requirements for top-level ontologies
   - Available at [ISO 71954](https://www.iso.org/standard/71954.html)

2. ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 - Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
   - Published November 2021
   - Standardizes BFO 2020 as a top-level ontology conforming to Part 1
   - Available at [ISO 74572](https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html)
